CodeGen_MySQL
=============

Abstract base package for MySQL code generators

This package contains common functionality used by all MySQL
related code generator packages. It is not functionally by
itself though, it just serves as an implementation framework
for MySQL related code generator packages just like CodeGen
does for code generator packages in general.
